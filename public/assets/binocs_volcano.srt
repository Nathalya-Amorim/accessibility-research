00:00:09,830 --> 00:00:12,000
Oh, hello friends!

2
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,000
Are you wondering what this is?

3
00:00:19,500 --> 00:00:24,599
Well, it's the molten lava that comes out from a volcano

4
00:00:26,000 --> 00:00:29,000
Come, let me tell you what a volcano is. 

5
00:00:29,500 --> 00:00:30,500
Zoooom in!

6
00:00:31,500 --> 00:00:34,000
I am sure you've seen mountains that open up 

7
00:00:34,000 --> 00:00:38,550
and blurt out thick molten semi-solid like substance?

8
00:00:40,000 --> 00:00:43,000
Well, that's called a volcano!

9
00:00:43,000 --> 00:00:44,500
Let’s learn more about it.

10
00:00:46,000 --> 00:00:49,000
A volcano is a vent or 'chimney' 

11
00:00:49,000 --> 00:00:52,000
that connects Magma from within the Earth’s crust

12
00:00:52,080 --> 00:00:54,000
to the Earth's surface.

13
00:00:55,000 --> 00:00:57,000
The liquid rock is called Magma 

14
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,000
when it is under the earth's surface

15
00:01:00,000 --> 00:01:04,000
and Lava after it comes out.

16
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:09,000
So how does a volcano erupt?

17
00:01:10,500 --> 00:01:13,000
The molten rock stored in the magma chamber 

18
00:01:13,000 --> 00:01:16,500
rises through the crater pipe pockets. 

19
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,000
As it travels up the main vent,

20
00:01:18,000 --> 00:01:24,000
gases expand and water becomes steam, creating pressure.

21
00:01:24,000 --> 00:01:26,500
When the pressure can no longer be contained

22
00:01:26,500 --> 00:01:29,000
the volcano erupts through the crater 

23
00:01:29,000 --> 00:01:32,230
and secondary side vents.

24
00:01:32,230 --> 00:01:35,000
Common volcanic gases include 

25
00:01:35,000 --> 00:01:38,940
water vapour, carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide,

26
00:01:38,940 --> 00:01:42,120
hydrogen chloride, hydrogen fluoride

27
00:01:42,120 --> 00:01:44,000
and hydrogen sulfide.

28
00:01:45,000 --> 00:01:47,000
Popular belief is that 

29
00:01:47,000 --> 00:01:52,000
Volcanoes are large cone-shaped mountains but that's not true. 

30
00:01:52,000 --> 00:01:55,500
There are many more types of volcanoes, such as -

31
00:01:55,500 --> 00:01:57,000
wide plateaus, 

32
00:01:57,000 --> 00:01:58,000
fissure vents 

33
00:01:58,000 --> 00:02:01,000
and bulging dome shapes.

34
00:02:01,000 --> 00:02:05,000
There are also volcanoes found on the ocean floor

35
00:02:05,000 --> 00:02:07,000
and even under icecaps

36
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:10,000
such as those found in Iceland. 

37
00:02:13,500 --> 00:02:14,000
The word volcano 

38
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:17,500
originally comes from the name of the Roman god of fire

39
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:19,000
Vulcan

40
00:02:21,000 --> 00:02:26,000
The tallest volcano in the Solar System isn’t on Earth at all

41
00:02:26,000 --> 00:02:29,000
but on Mars.

42
00:02:29,000 --> 00:02:31,000
So tune in next time 

43
00:02:31,000 --> 00:02:33,000
for some more fun filled facts. 

44
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,000
This is me Zooomin’ out
