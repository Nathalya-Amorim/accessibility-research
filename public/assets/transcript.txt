Oh, hello friends!
0:17
Are you wondering what this is?
0:19
Well, it's the molten lava that comes out from a volcano
0:26
Come, let me tell you what a volcano is.
0:29
Zoooom in!
0:31
I am sure you've seen mountains that open up
0:34
and blurt out thick molten semi-solid like substance?
0:40
Well, that's called a volcano!
0:43
Let’s learn more about it.
0:46
A volcano is a vent or 'chimney'
0:49
that connects Magma from within the Earth’s crust
0:52
to the Earth's surface.
0:55
The liquid rock is called Magma
0:57
when it is under the earth's surface
1:00
and Lava after it comes out.
1:06
So how does a volcano erupt?
1:10
The molten rock stored in the magma chamber
1:13
rises through the crater pipe pockets.
1:16
As it travels up the main vent,
1:18
gases expand and water becomes steam, creating pressure.
1:24
When the pressure can no longer be contained
1:26
the volcano erupts through the crater
1:29
and secondary side vents.
1:32
Common volcanic gases include
1:35
water vapour, carbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide,
1:38
hydrogen chloride, hydrogen fluoride
1:42
and hydrogen sulfide.
1:45
Popular belief is that
1:47
Volcanoes are large cone-shaped mountains but that's not true.
1:52
There are many more types of volcanoes, such as -
1:55
wide plateaus,
1:57
fissure vents
1:58
and bulging dome shapes.
2:01
There are also volcanoes found on the ocean floor
2:05
and even under icecaps
2:08
such as those found in Iceland.
2:13
The word volcano
2:14
originally comes from the name of the Roman god of fire
2:18
Vulcan
2:21
The tallest volcano in the Solar System isn’t on Earth at all
2:26
but on Mars.
2:29
So tune in next time
2:31
for some more fun filled facts.
