00:00:17.160 --> 00:00:22.040
VINCENT

2
00:00:34.756 --> 00:00:37.850
Vincent Malloy is seven years old,

3
00:00:37.900 --> 00:00:40.648
he's always polite and does what he's told.

4
00:00:41.356 --> 00:00:44.748
For a boy his age, he's considerate and nice,

5
00:00:45.500 --> 00:00:49.648
but he wants to be just like Vincent Price.

6
00:01:02.200 --> 00:01:05.548
He doesn't mind living with his sister,
dog and cats,

7
00:01:06.056 --> 00:01:09.948
though he'd rather share a home with spiders and bats.

8
00:01:18.456 --> 00:01:21.800
There he could reflect on the horrors he's invented...

9
00:01:25.656 --> 00:01:30.948
and wander dark hallways alone and tormented.

10
00:01:38.750 --> 00:01:41.948
Vincent is nice when his aunt comes to see him,

11
00:01:43.056 --> 00:01:47.648
but imagines dipping her in wax,
for his wax museum.

12
00:01:58.356 --> 00:02:01.648
He likes to experiment on his dog Abacrombie,

13
00:02:02.756 --> 00:02:05.748
in the hopes of creating a horrible zombie.

14
00:02:05.956 --> 00:02:08.248
So he and his horrible zombie dog...

15
00:02:10.456 --> 00:02:14.748
could go searching for victims in the London fog.

16
00:02:17.856 --> 00:02:21.048
His thoughts though aren't only of ghoulish crime,

17
00:02:21.056 --> 00:02:24.248
he likes to paint and read to pass some of the time.

18
00:02:24.256 --> 00:02:27.448
While other kids read books like "Go Jane Go",

19
00:02:27.456 --> 00:02:31.548
Vincent's favorite author is...
Edgar Allan Poe.

20
00:02:33.056 --> 00:02:35.648
One night while reading a gruesome tale,

21
00:02:35.656 --> 00:02:38.648
he read a passage that made him turn pale.

22
00:02:38.656 --> 00:02:41.048
Such horrible news he could not survive,

23
00:02:41.056 --> 00:02:44.648
for his beautiful wife had been buried alive.

24
00:02:48.656 --> 00:02:51.648
He dug out her grave to make sure she was dead,

25
00:02:52.056 --> 00:02:56.648
unaware that her grave,
was his mother's flower bed.

26
00:02:58.656 --> 00:03:01.648
His mother sent Vincent off to his room,

27
00:03:01.656 --> 00:03:04.648
he knew he'd been banished to the tower of doom.

28
00:03:04.756 --> 00:03:07.948
Where he was sentenced to spend the rest of his life,

29
00:03:07.956 --> 00:03:11.648
alone with the portrait of his beautiful wife.

30
00:03:13.900 --> 00:03:17.248
All alone and insane encased in his tomb,

31
00:03:17.356 --> 00:03:20.000
Vincent's mother burst suddenly into the room.

32
00:03:20.256 --> 00:03:23.648
She said:
"If you want to, you can go out and play,

33
00:03:23.656 --> 00:03:25.900
it's sunny outside, and a beautiful day."

34
00:03:31.856 --> 00:03:35.148
Vincent tried to talk,
but he just couldn't speak,

35
00:03:35.256 --> 00:03:38.648
the years of isolation had made him quite weak.

36
00:03:40.656 --> 00:03:43.948
So he took out some paper and scrawled with a pen:

37
00:03:43.956 --> 00:03:48.648
"I am possessed by this house,
and can never leave it again."

38
00:03:49.456 --> 00:03:53.648
His mother said: "You're not possessed
and you're not almost dead,

39
00:03:53.656 --> 00:03:56.648
these games that you play are all in your head.

40
00:03:56.656 --> 00:03:59.948
You're not Vincent Price,
you're Vincent Malloy,

41
00:03:59.956 --> 00:04:03.548
you're not tormented or insane,
you're just a young boy.

42
00:04:03.556 --> 00:04:06.348
You're seven years old and you are my son,

43
00:04:06.356 --> 00:04:09.648
I want you to get outside and have some real fun."

44
00:04:09.656 --> 00:04:12.748
Her anger now spent,
she walked out through the hall,

45
00:04:13.156 --> 00:04:16.348
while Vincent backed slowly against the wall.

46
00:04:16.356 --> 00:04:19.648
The room started to sway,
to shiver and creak,

47
00:04:19.656 --> 00:04:22.448
his horrid insanity had reached its peak.

48
00:04:23.656 --> 00:04:25.948
He saw Abacrombie, his zombie slave,

49
00:04:25.956 --> 00:04:28.648
and heard his wife call from beyond the grave.

50
00:04:28.656 --> 00:04:32.648
She spoke from the coffin,
and made ghoulish demands,

51
00:04:32.656 --> 00:04:35.848
while through cracking walls reached skeleton hands.

52
00:04:39.956 --> 00:04:43.148
Every horror in his life
that had crept through his dreams,

53
00:04:43.156 --> 00:04:46.748
swept his mad laughter to terrified screams.

54
00:04:48.456 --> 00:04:51.348
To escape the madness, he reached for the door,

55
00:04:51.356 --> 00:04:55.848
but fell limp and lifeless down on the floor.

56
00:04:56.956 --> 00:05:00.448
His voice was soft and very slow,

57
00:05:00.456 --> 00:05:04.648
as he quoted "The Raven" from Edgar Allan Poe:

58
00:05:04.856 --> 00:05:07.948
"And my soul from out that shadow...

59
00:05:08.100 --> 00:05:11.148
that lies floating on the floor...

60
00:05:11.756 --> 00:05:13.848
shall be lifted...

61
00:05:14.756 --> 00:05:16.748
NEVERMORE."
